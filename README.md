### Update 2: Computer audio to sign language

The program can now take your device's audio as input i.e. a video playing on your device online or offline, and use that sound as input for the speech recognotion system.

Just make sure you have stereo mix enabled on your computer as a recording device.

How to enable: control panel > Hardware and sound > Sound > Recording (tab on the pop-up that opens) >right-click stereo mix > enable

### Update 1: Now with speech recognition!

#### Speech to sign language video

## About

The SignSpeak automated sign language interpreter now has voice to sign language capability as well as text to sign language.

It's an alpha and not a beta because it just demos the concept of what I am trying to achieve but is not yet ready for general public use. It exists for enthusiasts or people who are following the development of the project.

It has a few signs loaded i.e: 

'a', 'afternoon', 'b', 'body', 'boy', 'brother', 'c', 'can', 'child', 'children', 'd', 'day', 'days', 'e', 'end', 'evening', 'expressions', 'f', 'facial', 'false', 'family', 'father', 'fingerspell', 'finish', 'friday', 'from', 'g', 'go', 'good', 'goodbye', 'h', 'happy', 'have', 'hello', 'help', 'home', 'how', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'kenya', 'l', 'language', 'm', 'man', 'me', 'meeting', 'member', 'monday', 'morning', 'mother', 'my', 'n', 'name', 'next', 'nice', 'night', 'no', 'o', 'p', 'parent', 'please', 'practice', 'q', 'r', 's', 'sad', 'same', 'saturday', 'school', 'see', 'sign', 'sister', 'sorry', 'start_sign', 'sunday', 't', 'thanks', 'thursday', 'to', 'tomorrow', 'too', 'true', 'tuesday', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'watch', 'wednesday', 'week', 'welcome', 'what', 'with', 'woman', 'work',
'x', 'y', 'yes', 'you', 'your', 'yours', 'z'

### Example sentences: 
* Hello my name is _your name_ (Make sure to capitalise the first letter for it to detect that it is a proper noun).
* Nice to meet you.
* This is a sign language interpreter.

## Tech used

The UI was made with Kivy.

The graphics pipeline was adapted from code obtained from the kivy3 library.

The animation code was adapted from xing-shuai's collada animator on github.

NLP done with SpaCy.

Offline speech recognition provided by Vosk models.


## The Future

I shall be adding more signs to it's vocabulary so that you can hold more meaningful conversations using this tool.
