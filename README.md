# SignSpeak

## The Alpha is here!

I call it an alpha but in reality it's a pre-alpha that demos the concept of what I am trying to achieve.

It has a few signs loaded i.e: the entire alphabet, hello, my, name, welcome, thank+you(specifically like this no other versions of thank you work), you, interpreter, me, meet, restroom, this

### Example sentences: 
* Hello my name is _your name_ (Make sure to capitalise the first letter for it to detect that it is a proper noun).
* Nice to meet you.
* This is a sign language interpreter.

## How to use 

[1] Unzip the zip file and look for SignSpeak.exe

[2] Double-click SignSpeak.exe wait for it to load and after that, you'll know what to do ðŸ˜‰


If you still need more explicit directions I have attatched a link to a youtube video showing exactly what to do below.


## Tech used

The UI was made with kivy==2.1.0.

The graphics pipeline was adapted from code obtained from the kivy3 library.

The animation code was adapted from xing-shuai's collada animator on github.


## The Future

I shall now start working on fully-automatic voice to sign language based on the same system.

I shall be adding more signs to it's vocabulary so that you can hold more meaningful conversations using this tool.


## Bye bye

Thanks to all those who've supported me over the span of making this but I'm also open to making new friends.
